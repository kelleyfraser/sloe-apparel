# Sloe Apparel - Fake ecommerce site for sustainable fashion brand

This project was created as a final capstone project for the HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp. This is a fully responsive site that allows users to browse products, sign in, and includes an interest calculator.

This is the first iteration of a complete ecommerce site. I will add a shopping cart functionality, and include a more comprehensive sign-in process.
